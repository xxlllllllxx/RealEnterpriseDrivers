<h2><a name="_Windows7"></a>Windows 7</h2>

<p>There are three major steps to add and connect to a Bluetooth device:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Discover the device:
  <ol>
   <li>Turn on the Bluetooth device and put it into the discoverable state. Consult your device user manual on how to do this.</li>
   <li>At the computer, click on the <b>Bluetooth</b> tray icon, and select the <b>Add a Device</b> menu item and perform a search process that will show all Bluetooth devices that are located in range of the computer.</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>Pair and establish a secure link with the device:
  <ol>
   <li>After the desired Bluetooth device appears in the <b>Add a Device</b> window, double click on the device icon or select the device icon, and click <b>Next</b>. Depending on the device type and security settings, you may be prompted to pair to the device. <br><b><i>Note:</i></b> Most Bluetooth devices require authentication (or pairing) to allow a connection before you can search for services.</li>
   <li>If the secret PIN codes entered or generated on the computer and Bluetooth device are the same, then the computer and Bluetooth device become paired. Select <b>Yes</b> to confirm that the secret PIN codes are the same when prompted and then click <b>Next</b>.</li>
   <li>A message on the <b>Add a Device</b> window will confirm a successful pairing. Click on the <b>Devices and Printers</b> link<sup>1</sup> to view the added device, and finish by clicking the <b>Close</b> button in the <b>Add a Device</b> window.</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>Connect your computer to the service of the Bluetooth device:
  <ol>
   <li>Double click on the added device icon to open the device's <b>Services</b> window.</li>
   <li>The Services window will show what can be done with the Bluetooth device (e.g., <b>Browse Remote Folder</b>, <b>Listen to Music</b>).</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
</ol>
