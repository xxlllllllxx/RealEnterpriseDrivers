<h1><a name="_working_with_files_over_bluetooth"></a>File Transfer over Bluetooth<sup>&reg;</sup></h1>

<p>Share local files and folders on your computer with other Bluetooth devices, transfer any type of file between your computer and Bluetooth devices, even create or delete files and folders on a Bluetooth device, and use the Send-To Wizard from the Microsoft Office menu to send files to Bluetooth devices.</p>

<p>Supported profiles and roles:</p>

<ul>
 <li>File Transfer Profile (FTP) (Client/Server)</li>
 <li>Basic Imaging Profile (BIP) (Initiator/Responder)</li>
 <li>Object Push Profile (OPP) (Client/Server)</li>
</ul>

<p>Supported features:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Object Exchange (OBEX) 1.5 Single Response Mode (SRM)</li>
 <li>Microsoft Office integration for Object Push Profile (OPP) client</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="_sharing_local_folder_for_bluetooth_devices"></a>Share Local Folder with Other Bluetooth Devices</h2>

<p>Folders on your computer can be shared with other Bluetooth devices by following the steps described in the <a href="cont_conf_bt.htm#_shared_folder_configuration">Folder Sharing Settings</a> section of this User's Guide.</p>

<p>Shared folder is used as the root folder for file transfer via FTP and as the default folder for receiving files via OPP and BIP.</p>

<h2><a name="_browsing_shared_folder">Browse Shared Folder of a Remote Bluetooth Device</a></h2>

<p>When connected to a Bluetooth device supporting FTP, a standard Explorer-like window may be used to conduct normal file operations between the device and the computer, just as they would be done locally:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Browse files and folders</li>
 <li>Transfer files and folders</li>
 <li>Delete files and folders</li>
 <li>Rename files and folders <br><b><i>Note:</i></b> If the remote device supports FTP server role less than v1.2 then only empty folders can be renamed.</li>
 <li>Create folders</li>
</ul>

<p>To access the shared folder on the remote device from the Service Window:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Open the device’s Services window (see <a href="star_new_devi.htm#_start_working_new_bluetooth_device">Add and Connect to a New Bluetooth<sup>&reg;</sup> Device</a>).</li>
 <li>Click on <b>Browse Remote Folder</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>To access the shared folder on the remote device from the Windows Explorer:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Open the <b>Computer</b> folder.</li>
 <li>Click on the icon with the remote device name.</li>
</ol>

<p><b><i>Note:</i></b> If the remote device supports FTP server role temporarily (i.e. FTP server role can be turned on or off), then link in the <b>Computer</b> folder can be absent. In this case use the remote device Services window.</p>

<p><b><i>Note:</i></b> During data exchange, the remote device may request a password, in which case both devices must enter the same password to enable the connection. If the passwords do not match, the connection will be terminated.</p>

<h2><a name="_sending_files">Send Files to a Bluetooth Device</a></h2>

<p><b>Send File To Bluetooth Device Wizard</b> is used to send files to the remote Bluetooth device. Wizard is able to send single file but several wizards can be launched simultaneously. A sequence of steps is provided to select target remote device and file to send. <b>Send File To Bluetooth Device Wizard</b> can be executed in several scenarios.</p>

<p><b><i>Note:</i></b> Typically, BIP is used for sending pictures from a mobile device to a computer. OPP is used for sending all other types of files. <b>Send File To Bluetooth Device Wizard</b> supports both profiles.</p>

<h3><a name="_modifying_files"></a>Modify Files and Folders from a Bluetooth Device</h3>

<p>A Bluetooth device that supports FTP profile can make changes to files and folders in the local shared folder. Special permissions will be requested if the remote device will try to overwrite, rename or delete shared content. The <b>Permission request</b> window will appear before these changes can be done.
